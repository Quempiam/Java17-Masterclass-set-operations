# Java 17 Masterclass - set opperations

Using given code (included in first commit) specify the following:
* what is the full task list (this is the list of all tasks described by your manager, and any additional tasks 
    the employees have, that may not be on that list).
* which tasks are assigned to at least one of your team members
* which tasks still need to be assigned
* which tasks are assigned to multiple employees

To do so, create 3 methods in Main Class:
* getUnion - returns the union of given list of sets
* getIntersect - returns the intersection of two sets
* getDifference - returns the result of subtracting the second set from the first one

> Do not mutate sets in these methods - return a *new* set.
